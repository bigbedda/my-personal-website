        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <h2><em>Welcome</em>, my name is Stuart Bedford and this is my website. This site is a work in progress and as such, new pages, media etc will continue to be added as time goes by and my knowledge increases.</h2>

        <p><strong>This</strong> is my first website that I have created myself from scratch using the information I have learned from doing html and css course on scrimba,<br>
        as I learn and delve into the subject more this website will become more and more complicated, have more and more items and pages <br>
        and hopefully become the base from which I show off all my future projects along side where I keep my blog</p>
