        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>O</strong>n this page i'll be sharing my hobbies and interests with you,each item in the lists below will take you to a page about the item.<br>
        I'll add a link to the official website (If there is one), add some pictures, whether its the cover art, my character, a scene, or just something related to it.</p>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>The three games below are the games that I enjoy the most and found myself immersed in quite frequently.
            <ul>
                <li style="color: gold"><a href="world-of-warcraft.html">World of Warcraft</a></li>
                <li style="color: red"><a href="assassins-creed.html">Assassin's Creed</a></li>
                <li><a href="the-division.html">The Division</a></li>
                <img src="img/division-01.jpg" height="25%" width="25%">
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Anime</h2>
        <p>Alongside gaming, I enjoy watching anime, all different genres ranging from action to horror to isekai, (reborn in another world) plus much more.<br></p>
        <p>As mentioned on the homepage this website is a major work in progress, but in the future i'm hoping to add a function in here where you will be
        able to seach through anime i've watched and my thoughts based on name, genre, what year it was out, number of seasons or number of episodes, this little project is
        a while away at the moment though.
